      <p><b>Initial Funding: </b>In August 1998, Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, provided a crucial initial investment of $100,000 to the fledgling company.</p>

      <p><b>Initial Public Offering (IPO):</b> Google's IPO took place on August 19, 2004, raising $1.67 billion and valuing the company at over $23 billion. The IPO was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol GOOG.</p>
      <p><b>Company Culture: </b>Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, famously reduced their salaries to $1 after the IPO, emphasizing their commitment to the company's long-term vision and values. They reassured investors that the IPO would not change the company's innovative culture.</p>
      <p><b>Global Influence: </b>Google's impact on language and culture is significant, with the term "google" being officially added to dictionaries as a verb meaning "to search the internet using Google."

      <p><b>Corporate Structure:</b> In 2015, Google reorganized its interests under a holding company called Alphabet Inc., with Google serving as its leading subsidiary. This restructuring allowed Google to focus on its core internet-related businesses while exploring new ventures under Alphabet's umbrella.</p>
      <p><b>Ongoing Developments: </b>Google's journey is marked by ongoing developments, including regulatory challenges, antitrust investigations, and initiatives to address social and environmental issues.
